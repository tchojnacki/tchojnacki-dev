# Introduction

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

Artificial neural networks may seem terrifying. Wikipedia defines them as "models that are built
using principles of neuronal organization discovered by connectionism in the biological neural
networks constituting animal brains"<Cite ordinal={1} />. While mostly accurate, this definition does not
really help you understand how these constructs work. A description which is much less mysterious, is that
artificial neural networks are, at their core, a **certain class of huge mathematical expressions**.

That's why in this post, we will build a simple neural network in plain JavaScript, keeping this
approach in mind. We will start with the smallest building blocks &ndash; numbers, and then we will
gradually compose them into neurons, layers, and finally, a multi-layer perceptron.

The code built in this post is used purely for educational purposes. In particular, the final library
is not optimized for performance, nor is it suitable for production use. I will use the simplest (and
not always the best) algorithms to keep the topic as simple as possible. If you are seeking a mature
neural network library for JS, I'd recommend looking at [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js).

## Related work

There are plenty of other resources describing the construction of neural networks without any external
frameworks. In particular, I'd recommend the "[Neural Networks from Scratch in Python](https://nnfs.io)"
book, and its accompanying YouTube series. However, most of these resources jump straight into
building the layers, and work directly with matrices and vectors.

A counterexample, would be the phenomenal [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) library
by Andrej Karpathy, which takes a much closer approach to the one I'm going to present here.

## Prerequisites

The post assumes that you know your way around JavaScript, and that you have a surface-level
understanding of the mathematical concepts behind neural networks, in particular you should know
how to differentiate using the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule).

The only required software is a working web browser, which you do have if you are reading this post.
We won't be using Node.js, npm, or any other tools. You can write the entire code in the browser's
console, but I'd recommend grabbing a text editor and creating a bare-bones HTML file instead.

If you prefer to read typed code, you can use the following switch to enable
[JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) type annotations in all the code snippets:

# Basics of scalar automatic differentiation

The engine, that we are going to build is **scalar**, which means that we will work on single floating
point number values, as opposed to their (possibly multidimensional) arrays. The other approach, which
operates on **tensors**, is much more common, and way faster, but also more complex.

The basic building block of the entire system is the `Scalar` class, which represents a single number.
Its initial form is just a wrapper around a JavaScript `number`:

<JsdocSyntax typed={`
class Scalar {
  /** @type {number} */
  value;

  /** @param {number} value */
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
  }
}
`} untyped={`
class Scalar {
  value;

  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
  }
}
`} />

As mentioned before, we want to build huge mathematical expressions from these numbers, and to do that,
we want to be able to compose them using different operations. For instance, we can implement
`add` and `mul`, responsible for addition and multiplication. Our `Scalar` will hold an additional
private property called `#children`, which is a list of scalars used as its subexpressions:

<JsdocSyntax typed={`
class Scalar {
  /**
  * @param {Scalar} other
  * @returns {Scalar}
  */
  add(other) {
    const out = new Scalar(this.value + other.value);
    out.#children = [this, other];
    return out;
  }

  /**
  * @param {Scalar} other
  * @returns {Scalar}
  */
  mul(other) {
    const out = new Scalar(this.value * other.value);
    out.#children = [this, other];
    return out;
  }
}
`} untyped={`
class Scalar {
  add(other) {
    const out = new Scalar(this.value + other.value);
    out.#children = [this, other];
    return out;
  }

  mul(other) {
    const out = new Scalar(this.value * other.value);
    out.#children = [this, other];
    return out;
  }
}
`} />

This lets us build some simple expressions, like:
<Syntax lang="javascript" code={`
const x = new Scalar(3);
const y = new Scalar(4);
const z = new Scalar(5);
console.log(x.add(y).mul(z));
`} />

<SimpleScalarExample client:idle />

The core concept that we are going to use in our models is **optimization**. We want to, given an
expression, find the values of its parameters (which are just `Scalar` instances) that ensures our
inputs are transformed into the desired outputs.

For instance, let's say that our expression is <Math latex="y = x + p" />, where <Math latex="x" />
is an input and <Math latex="p" /> is a parameter. We want to know, how <Math latex="p" /> should be
changed, so that the relationship between <Math latex="x" /> and <Math latex="y" /> is as close to
the desired one as possible. Let's say that the modelled function should return 3 for input 2, and our
parameter is initially set to 5. Obviously, we should decrease the parameter, since the current
output is larger than the desired one.

The formal way to do this is to calculate the **partial derivative** of the output with respect to
the parameter, and then nudge the parameter in the opposite direction. This derivative quantifies the
sensitivity of changes in the output with respect to changes in the parameter. In our previous example,
we get <Math latex="\frac{\partial y}{\partial p} = 1" />, which means that increasing <Math latex="p" /> increases
<Math latex="y" /> by the same amount. Therefore, we should decrease <Math latex="p" />.

In our system, the automatic differentiation can be achieved using **backpropagation**. This method
is an application of the chain rule, which goes backwards from the result towards the inputs, and
calculates the partial derivatives along the way. Mathematically, this is the relevant substitution<Cite ordinal={2} />:
<Math block latex="\dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial w_1}\dfrac{\partial w_1}{\partial x} = \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial w_1}\dfrac{\partial w_1}{\partial w_2}\dfrac{\partial w_2}{\partial x} = \dots" />

I won't go into the details of backpropagation, since it could very well be a topic for a separate
post. If you want to dive deeper into this concept, I'd recommend [3Blue1Brown's video on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8).
This article will instead focus on the implementation.

Let's add the partial derivatives, and means to update them to our `Scalar` class. We can introduce
two new properties: `partial`, initially equal to zero, holding the current value of the partial
derivative, and `#propagate`, which is a function responsible for updating the derivatives of the
children, based on the derivative of the current node. We can rewrite the `add` method as:

<JsdocSyntax typed={`
class Scalar {
  /**
    * @param {Scalar} other
    * @returns {Scalar}
    */
  add(other) {
    const out = new Scalar(this.value + other.value);
    out.#children = [this, other];
    out.#propagate = () => {
      this.partial += out.partial;
      other.partial += out.partial;
    };
    return out;
  }
}
`} untyped={`
class Scalar {
  add(other) {
    const out = new Scalar(this.value + other.value);
    out.#children = [this, other];
    out.#propagate = () => {
      this.partial += out.partial;
      other.partial += out.partial;
    };
    return out;
  }
}
`} />

For reference, <Math latex="\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (x + y) = 1" />, or in other words, any
change in either addend results in the same change in the sum. This should explain the body of the
`#propagate` function. This pattern is so common, that we can create a helper function, called `#op`,
which is a factory for composed scalars, and rewrite the `add` method:

<JsdocSyntax typed={`
class Scalar {
  /**
    * @param {Scalar[]} children
    * @param {number} value
    * @param {(out: Scalar) => void} propagate
    * @returns {Scalar}
    */
  static #op(children, value, propagate) {
    const out = new Scalar(value);
    out.#children = children;
    out.#propagate = () => propagate(out);
    return out;
  }

  /**
   * @param {Scalar} other
   * @returns {Scalar}
   */
  add(other) {
    return Scalar.#op([this, other], this.value + other.value, out => {
      this.partial += out.partial;
      other.partial += out.partial;
    });
  }
}
`} untyped={`
class Scalar {
  static #op(children, value, propagate) {
    const out = new Scalar(value);
    out.#children = children;
    out.#propagate = () => propagate(out);
    return out;
  }

  add(other) {
    return Scalar.#op([this, other], this.value + other.value, out => {
      this.partial += out.partial;
      other.partial += out.partial;
    });
  }
}
`} />

We can now define arbitrary operations on the `Scalar` instances, as long as we know how to calculate
their result and how to propagate their derivatives. Here are some useful ones, namely: summation,
multiplication, exponentiation, subtraction, and division:
<JsdocSyntax typed={`
class Scalar {
  /**
   * @param {Scalar[]} scalars
   * @returns {Scalar}
   */
  static sum(scalars) {
    return Scalar.#op(
      scalars,
      scalars.reduce((acc, s) => acc + s.value, 0),
      out =>
        scalars.forEach(s => {
          s.partial += out.partial;
        })
    );
  }

  /**
   * @param {Scalar} other
   * @returns {Scalar}
   */
  mul(other) {
    return Scalar.#op([this, other], this.value * other.value, out => {
      this.partial += other.value * out.partial;
      other.partial += this.value * out.partial;
    });
  }

  /**
   * @param {number} n
   * @returns {Scalar}
   */
  pow(n) {
    return Scalar.#op([this], this.value ** n, out => {
      this.partial += n * this.value ** (n - 1) * out.partial;
    });
  }

  /**
   * @param {Scalar} other
   * @returns {Scalar}
   */
  sub(other) {
    return this.add(other.mul(new Scalar(-1)));
  }

  /**
   * @param {Scalar} other
   * @returns {Scalar}
   */
  div(other) {
    return this.mul(other.pow(-1));
  }
}
`} untyped={`
class Scalar {
  static sum(scalars) {
    return Scalar.#op(
      scalars,
      scalars.reduce((acc, s) => acc + s.value, 0),
      out =>
        scalars.forEach(s => {
          s.partial += out.partial;
        })
    );
  }

  mul(other) {
    return Scalar.#op([this, other], this.value * other.value, out => {
      this.partial += other.value * out.partial;
      other.partial += this.value * out.partial;
    });
  }

  pow(n) {
    return Scalar.#op([this], this.value ** n, out => {
      this.partial += n * this.value ** (n - 1) * out.partial;
    });
  }

  sub(other) {
    return this.add(other.mul(new Scalar(-1)));
  }

  div(other) {
    return this.mul(other.pow(-1));
  }
}
`} />

The final piece of the puzzle, which makes the `Scalar` class pretty much feature-complete, is the
`derive` method, which fills out all the `partial` properties in arbitrarily nested subexpressions.

We have to make some observations. First, the partial derivative of a scalar with respect to itself
is just one (<Math latex="\frac{\partial x}{\partial x} = 1" />). Second, all other derivatives are
initially equal to zero. In some frameworks, for greater flexibility, this is done manually by the
user (for example `Optimizer.zero_grad` in PyTorch), but we can zero them out before every calculation
for simplicity. Finally, the order in which we propagate the derivatives is important in the general
case. We should start from the output, and go backwards, but since one variable can be used multiple
times in different subexpressions, we have to do a **topological sort** of the graph of the expression.
This means that we try to find an order in which we calculate all the dependencies before computing
their dependents. Note that this order always exists for our `Scalar` class, since because the
`#children` property is never modified, the graph has to be acyclic.

<Banner kind="warning">
The topological sort is required here, since we aim to support arbitrary math expressions. In artificial
neural networks, the division of the computational graph into layers makes the sort unnecessary, since
a given layer depends only on the previous one. This means that simply iterating over the layers in
reverse order implicitly produces the topological ordering.
</Banner>

These three requirements lead us directly to the algorithm presented below:
<JsdocSyntax typed={`
class Scalar {
  derive() {
    const order = topologicalSort(this, s => s.#children);

    for (const s of order) {
      s.partial = 0;
    }

    this.partial = 1;

    for (const s of order) {
      s.#propagate();
    }
  }
}
`} untyped={`
class Scalar {
  derive() {
    const order = topologicalSort(this, s => s.#children);

    for (const s of order) {
      s.partial = 0;
    }

    this.partial = 1;

    for (const s of order) {
      s.#propagate();
    }
  }
}
`} />

This is the core of the `Scalar` class. We can extend it to add more operations, or some utility
methods, but the current form is enough to build some models and optimize them. Let's consolidate
our current knowledge with an example:
<Math block latex="f = \dfrac{2x - 3}{x^3 + x^2 - x}" />
<JsdocSyntax typed={`
const x = new Scalar(1);
const numerator = new Scalar(2).mul(x).sub(new Scalar(3)); // 2x - 3
const denominator = x.pow(3).add(x.pow(2)).sub(x); // x^3 + x^2 - x
const f = numerator.div(denominator);
f.derive();
console.log(x.partial); // => 6
console.log(f);
`} untyped={`
const x = new Scalar(1);
const numerator = new Scalar(2).mul(x).sub(new Scalar(3)); // 2x - 3
const denominator = x.pow(3).add(x.pow(2)).sub(x); // x^3 + x^2 - x
const f = numerator.div(denominator);
f.derive();
console.log(x.partial); // => 6
console.log(f);
`} />

# A simple linear regression model

We can use the class to build some **models** or in other words, functions which map inputs to predicted
outputs. For our purposes, we will assume that a model takes many inputs, but returns a single output.
This choice is arbitrary, we could also handle multiple outputs, or single inputs with little change.

We can define an abstract `Model` class, which we can later extend to create specific models. The
`Scalar.wrap` function used inside `predict` transforms an array of numbers into an array of `Scalar` instances.

<JsdocSyntax typed={`
/** @abstract */
class Model {
  /** @returns {Scalar[]} */
  parameters() {
    throw new TypeError("Method \`parameters\` must be implemented!");
  }

  /**
   * @param {Scalar[]} x
   * @returns {Scalar}
   */
  evaluate(x) {
    throw new TypeError("Method \`evaluate\` must be implemented!");
  }

  /** @param {number[]} x  */
  predict(x) {
    return this.evaluate(Scalar.wrap(x)).value;
  }
}
`} untyped={`
class Model {
  parameters() {
    throw new TypeError("Method \`parameters\` must be implemented!");
  }

  evaluate(x) {
    throw new TypeError("Method \`evaluate\` must be implemented!");
  }

  predict(x) {
    return this.evaluate(Scalar.wrap(x)).value;
  }
}
`} />

The core of the class is the `#loss` method shown below, which calculates how much the predicted
value differ from the real result. What's crucial is that the method returns a `Scalar` instance.
This means that we can use `derive` to see how the parameters affect the error, and then use this
information to update them.

We are using the mean squared error, which is a pretty simple metric &ndash; it's just the average
of squared differences between the predicted and real values. The `#loss` method can be modified to
improve our model's performance, for instance by adding
[regularization](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#regularization).

<JsdocSyntax typed={`
/** @abstract */
class Model {
  /**
   * @param {number[][]} X
   * @param {number[]} y
   * @returns {Scalar}
   */
  #loss(X, y) {
    const inputs = Scalar.wrap(X);
    const outputs = Scalar.wrap(y);
    const guesses = inputs.map((x) => this.evaluate(x));
    const errors = guesses.map((g, i) => g.sub(outputs[i]).pow(2));
    return Scalar.sum(errors).div(new Scalar(errors.length));
  }

  /**
   * @param {number[][]} X
   * @param {number[]} y
   * @param {number} eta
   * @returns {number}
   */
  fit(X, y, eta) {
    const loss = this.#loss(X, y);
    loss.derive();
    for (const p of this.parameters()) {
      p.value -= eta * p.partial;
    }
    return loss.value;
  }
}
`} untyped={`
class Model {
  #loss(X, y) {
    const inputs = Scalar.wrap(X);
    const outputs = Scalar.wrap(y);
    const guesses = inputs.map((x) => this.evaluate(x));
    const errors = guesses.map((g, i) => g.sub(outputs[i]).pow(2));
    return Scalar.sum(errors).div(new Scalar(errors.length));
  }

  fit(X, y, eta) {
    const loss = this.#loss(X, y);
    loss.derive();
    for (const p of this.parameters()) {
      p.value -= eta * p.partial;
    }
    return loss.value;
  }
}
`} />

The `fit` method is what we'd call the **training**. The `eta` parameter is the learning rate, which
determines how much we want to update the weights in each step. If set too low, the convergence will
be slow, and if set too high, we might overshoot while searching.

<Banner kind="warning">
  The `fit` function often refers to a training loop, which repeatedly calculates the loss and
  updates the parameters. In this example, the method does only a single pass of optimization
  and is meant to be called multiple times.
</Banner>

What we defined above is enough to build a simple linear regression model. This is a model, which
transforms a single input into a single output, according to the following formula:
<Math block latex="y = ax + b" />

Since we assumed that models take many inputs, here we only take the first array element and ignore
the rest. The subclass is as follows:
<JsdocSyntax typed={`
class Linear extends Model {
  /** @type {Scalar} */
  #a;
  /** @type {Scalar} */
  #b;

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.#a = new Scalar(0);
    this.#b = new Scalar(0);
  }

  /**
   * @override
   * @returns {Scalar[]}
   */
  parameters() {
    return [this.#a, this.#b];
  }

  /**
   * @override
   * @param {Scalar[]} x
   * @returns {Scalar}
   */
  evaluate(x) {
    return this.#a.mul(x[0]).add(this.#b);
  }
}
`} untyped={`
class Linear extends Model {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.#a = new Scalar(0);
    this.#b = new Scalar(0);
  }

  parameters() {
    return [this.#a, this.#b];
  }

  evaluate(x) {
    return this.#a.mul(x[0]).add(this.#b);
  }
}
`} />

Let's say our dataset consists of the following datapoints: <br /> `(3.1, -0.6)`, `(-0.1, -1.9)`, `(4, 0)`, `(-2.1, -3)`.

We can train our model as follows:
<JsdocSyntax typed={`
const linear = new Linear();
const X = [[3.1], [-0.1], [4], [-2.1]];
const y = [-0.6, -1.9, 0, -3];
for (let k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
  linear.fit(X, y, 0.1);
}
console.log(linear.predict([1])); // => -1.48
console.log(linear);
`} untyped={`
const linear = new Linear();
const X = [[3.1], [-0.1], [4], [-2.1]];
const y = [-0.6, -1.9, 0, -3];
for (let k = 0; k < 100; k++) {
  linear.fit(X, y, 0.1);
}
console.log(linear.predict([1])); // => -1.48
console.log(linear);
`} />
