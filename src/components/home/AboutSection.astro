      I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;software engineer with strong front-end expertise in modern web technologies,
      particularly React and TypeScript, complemented by experience in Python, Rust, Node.js,
      machine learning, databases, and DevOps. I&nbsp;hold both a&nbsp;BSc and an&nbsp;MSc degree in
      Applied Computer Science with a&nbsp;specialization in Software Engineering from Wroc≈Çaw
      University of Science and Technology, where I&nbsp;graduated with top honors and was actively
      involved in scientific research. During my internship at Atlassian, I&nbsp;contributed to
      Jira's Forge platform by shipping production features, fixing bugs, and improving internal
      monitoring. My experience spans the design and development of a&nbsp;wide range of personal,
      academic, and real-world software systems.
